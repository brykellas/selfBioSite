                        <p>
                            Working as an Operations Specialist at two landfills with WM, I fill several roles at the 
                            office. When tech issues arise in the scale house, I become the unofficial IT guy. If we 
                            are short-staffed at the scale, then I cover the breaks and lunches if not just fill-in 
                            entirely. I handle site level account payables and various reporting needed for accounting.

                            Learned to do some DIY work via YouTube. I was able to demo and retile my shower. Even patched 
                            the stucco on my house.

                            General labor through a temporary employment agency. I did a lot of sign holding for stores 
                            closing down. Also gained some experience in concrete work, filling in an inground hot tub at 
                            a hotel.

                            Sales Floor Associate at Kmart. Started working here in 2012 just as Kmart announced they were 
                            closing their stores. My main responsibility was breaking down and selling fixtures around the 
                            store as the existing stock sold out.

                        <p>
                            Very much enjoy playing video games, whether it's playing <i>Warzone 2</i> with my friend or a 
                            story-driven single player game. It's not just that games are fun, I find them to be an art. 
                            They can bring out so many emotions. I mean, <i>The Last of Us</i> was an amazing story-driven 
                            game before it was a highly rated TV show. The game was backed by great acting to carry it to 
                            that point. 
                        </p><p>
                            My current Steam backlog has about 260 plus titles that I still haven't played.

                            The brown chihuahua is Coco and the white corgi mix is Chico. They are family. 
                        </p><p> 
                            Chico loves to play and does not seem to get tired of it. He is the first dog I've seen that 
                            will squeak a toy to get my attention. He will look at me, squeak the toy, drop it, and watch 
                            me, expecting me to be as excited as him about the squeak.
                        </p><p>
                            Coco loves attention and will lay there for hours if she is being pet. But if I start playing 
                            with Chico, she will walk away and lie down somewhere else. Coco hates fun. 
                        </p><p>
                            They both love going for walks and go crazy with excitement if I grab their harnesses.

                            While I do not cook a lot, I do enjoy cooking new things. I can't bring myself to eat a 
                            store-bought lasagna anymore after making one myself. Getting meal kits delivered gave me the 
                            opportunity to try cooking different dishes.
                        </p><p>
                            Nowadays, I like to cook things I see on YouTube that seem like they would be good so I can try 
                            them. My favorite cooking videos to watch are Sorted Food and Chef James Makinson, I've learn 
                            many new things from them.
